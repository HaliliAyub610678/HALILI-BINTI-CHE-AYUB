                  First of all, I would like to thank to ALLAH S.W.T and His messenger, Prophet Muhammad S.A.W. 
                  It is because of HIS blessing; it is possible for me to finish my first individual assignment.
                  I had finally managed to finish up this project with great enthusiasm and determination. 
                 Therefore, I want to acknowledge with thanks, the individual who had guided me in making this project which is to my Introduction to Web Content Management & Design
                 (IMD311) lecturer, Madam Seri Intan Idayu Binti Shahrul Asari who had guided me on how to complete this assignment.
                 Every week in her class, she always reminds and gives guidelines on how to search information about this assignment properly. 
                 I would like to thanks to all my friends who gave me support and advices. Last but not least, I would like to say thanks to my parents who always prayed well for me and spending their time to hear my problems. I hope my assignment is complete and will be receive.

                 To be honestly, this is my first time i have been creating my own website or blog in this subject. Not to mention that actually, i am so excited to create it eventhough it was hard for me for the first time, but i want to overcome with brave heart and professional by learning and understanding this subject properly. Regarding to this individual project, i was informed to create or produce personal website using multiple software such as Notepad/ Notepad++/Any text -based authoring tool only based on HTML topic that I have learned so far. For you information, it required me to create around 6 or 7 HTML website where it consist of:<p>
        <p>
        
        <ol type="i">

                <li>Home Page</li>
                <br>
                <li>Biodata</li>
                <br>
                <li>Experience</li>
                <br>
                <li>Education</li>
                <br>
                <li>Gallery</li>
                <br>
                <li>Family</li>
                <br>
                <li>And other neccesary pages</li>
                <br>
        </ol>
    <br>
  
                 But for the other neccessary pages, I will highlight about my <b> favourite music band </b> that I love the most. Since I am last my semester which is part 5 and I have a few month because graduate, I would like to use this opportunity to tell more about myself in this blog as I can express myself to gain more confident.<p>
